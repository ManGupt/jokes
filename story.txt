Stories 

1. Boy was hungry was having fainting feeling, he thought there will be no food at home. He started going door to door for food. At one home he was given glass full of milk by a girl. He tried to pay for the milk but girl refused. Time went by both grew up. Girl fell ill and nobody was able to cure. She went to a hospital and City's biggest doctor cured her with effort. Note the woman thought how will she pay her bill. When she received the bill it was written "paid in full with glass of milk". 

Good deeds pay off.
