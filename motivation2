One Day...Yamraja came to a Guy and said:

"Hey, today is your last day!"

Guy:  "But i'm not ready!".
:-) :-)
Yamraja said:  "Well today your name is the first on my list...".

Guy: "Okay, then why don't you take a seat and We will drink a COFFEE before we go?"

Yamraja: "All right..".

The Guy gave Yamraja some COFFEE  with sleeping pills in it.
Yamraja finished COFFEE and fell into a deep sleep!!!

The Guy took the list & removed his name from top of the list and put at the bottom of the list!

When Yamraja woke up he said to the Guy: "Because you have been so nice to me, now I will start my job  from the BOTTOM of the list.." !!!

Moral:

Whatever is written in your Destiny ...
Will never change... no matter how much u try....
So, in Bhagwad geeta- Shri Krishna Says:

"Tu karta wohi hai
Jo tu chahata hai,

Par hota wohi hai
jo mai chahata hu !

Tu kar woh jo mai Chahata hu ....
Fir hoga woh jo tu chahta hai...

*Know Your Value...!!! *
A well-known speaker started off his seminar by holding up a Rupee 500 note.In the room of 200, he asked, "Who would like this Rupee 500 note?" Hands started going up.
He said, "I am going to give this note to one of you but first let me do this." He proceeded to crumple the note up.
He then asked, "Who still wants it?" Still the hands were up in the air. "Well," he replied, "What if I do this?" 
And he dropped it on the ground and started to grind it into the floor with his shoe. He picked it up, now all crumpled and dirty.
"Now who still wants it?" Still the hands went into the air. "My friends, you have all learned a very valuable lesson.
No matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it because it did not decrease in value. It was still worth Rupee 500/-.
Many times in our lives, we are dropped, crumpled, and ground into the dirt by the decisions we make and the circumstances that come our way.
We feel as though we are worthless.But no matter what has happened or what will happen, you will never lose your value.
You are special. Don't ever forget it! Never let yesterday's disappointments overshadow tomorrow's dreams.

Gyan ki 3 Baate hmesa yad rkhna
Gyan no 1?:

Agar koi hume accha lagta hai to accha wo nahi hum hai...

Aur agar koi hume bura lagta hai to bura wahi hai Qki hum to acche hai na... ????????

Gyan no 2?:

Zindagi se koi cheez maango to aise maango jaise tumhare baap ki thi.

Aur nahi mili to kaunsi tumhare baap ki thi.

Kundi dono taraf se hoti hai aap bhi bahar se band karke bhaag jao...
